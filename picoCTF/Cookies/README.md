<!--SHORT DESCRIPTION OF CHALLENGE AND INFERENCE REACHED-->
### Initial Observations

Upon launching the site, I saw a basic input field, it requests a type of cookie and responds with how the creator feels about it.<br><br>

## ðŸ§  Approach
Given the challenge name (`Cookies`), I suspected the vulnerability would be related to the cookies on the website, so I loaded up BurpSuite to analyze the requests in more detail.<br>

First thing I notice sending the request was ```Cookie```, which had a value of 0. To test if this value changes, I decided to input sugar into the field and observe the Cookie value.<br><br>

As expected, the value did change! The value of Cookie changed from 0 (representing snickerdoodle cookies), to 7 (representing sugar cookies).<br><br>

Having confirmed that the different cookies are tied to the different cookie values in this request, I send the burp request to the Intruder to test many different cookie values and observe the results. I specify the cookie value as the payload, and decide to test values 1 through 20.<br><br>

<br><br>
After the Intruder attack finished, I review the results and use the search function to filter for the text "not very special", since I know this text shows up for an incorrect input. Therefore, if a response doesn't contain this string, it must be correct!

After moving through the list and just paying attention to the bottom right where it says "1 match", I finally see a payload that received a response containing 0 highlights of the string "not very special". Specifically, the payload that didn't get this response was ```Cookie: name = 18```.<br><br>

Within the Response, I find the flag for this challenge!
