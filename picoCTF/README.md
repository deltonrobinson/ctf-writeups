# picoCTF Writeups üß†üîê

This repository contains my personal writeups for challenges from [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/), an educational Capture The Flag competition focused on cybersecurity fundamentals. These writeups reflect my approach to solving each challenge, along with the tools, thought process, and techniques I used.

## üìö What‚Äôs Inside (WIP, READMEs will be created soon)

Each folder or file is organized by challenge name and includes:
- **Challenge Description** (as presented by picoCTF)
- **Problem-Solving Approach**  
- **Tools Used** (`nmap`, `Wireshark`, `Python`, browser dev tools, etc.)
- **Command Examples / Payloads**  
- **Flags (with explanations)**  
- **Lessons Learned / Concepts Covered**

## üõ† Tools & Techniques Covered So Far
- Linux fundamentals & file permissions  
- Web exploitation (XSS, SSTI, cookies, request tampering)  
- Basic cryptography & encoding (Base64, XOR, Caesar)  
- Network analysis with `netcat`, `tcpdump`, and `Wireshark`  
<!-- - Scripting in Python and Bash for automation
- Reverse engineering (strings, Ghidra, file inspection) -->

## üß† Why I‚Äôm Doing This
These writeups serve both as personal notes and a portfolio of my learning. They help me reinforce concepts and share knowledge with others entering the field.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
All challenges were completed in legal, educational environments (picoCTF.com). This repo is intended solely for learning and ethical security research.
