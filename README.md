# CTF Writeups 🧩📁

A growing collection of writeups from CTF challenges outside of picoCTF.  
Mostly TryHackMe and random practice labs — more coming soon.

## ✍️ What’s Here (So Far)
Just getting started! This will house:
- Notes on challenge structure and approach
- Commands, payloads, and tooling used
- Lessons learned, mistakes made, and cool takeaways

## 🧠 Purpose
This repo helps me document and reflect as I build my skills in ethical hacking and problem-solving.
